- Hi, I’m @Robotic24

  GENERAL INFO
-I'm 15 years old and I am a Californian, some of my hobbies include chess, hacking, football, computer hardware
 , hunting, fishing, and most puzzles that aren't jigsaw puzzles.
-I’m interested in cybersecurity, I love blue team and red team although i'm more skilled in red team. This is the career field I wish to pursue.
   
     LINUX EXPERIENCE
   -I have worked with multiple security OSes. Some of the following are, Kali Lunux, Black Arch, Parrot OS (Which is my favorite), and Backbox
   -I know Linux fairly well and I use it as an everyday OS. I'm loving it more than Windows and I know terminal commands better than windows now.
    Mac OS will forever be better in my opinion though.
    
    CODING EXPERIENCE
-I’m currently learning python and how to use it in a pentest environment. I already know Java but I don't see much application for it anymore.
  I also know HTML and CSS but most coders don't count that as real coding so take it as you will.
